Hi, My name is Dani Pragustia,
This blog about things that interest me, most is about software and technology and sometimes mumble about something around the world and myself.

English isn't my primary language, for mostly time I using Bahasa Indonesia.

### Favourites
- I like almost any kind of game, if that doesnt make me <b>bad mood</b>
- Mostly my music is <b>classical music</b>, but i like the music if it good at my taste
- I enjoy book with genres like <b>science fiction, mystery, history</b>

### My Computer
I primary use Thinkpad X200, the best laptop ever made, Its durable and compact. Disassembly laptop is very simple and all parts of this machine is user replaceable and cheap (on local market as low as ~50$ including motherboard itself). This laptop still good almost 10 years without any major issue. But there some issue like cpu itself pretty old Core 2 Duo and it struggle to running any video up to 720p (x264 is fine).

For any heavy computing compiling, I use hourly VPS but this only rarely case.

I also have phone as my media center, it was <b>Xiaomi Redmi 3 Pro</b> which the best phone and I have two of them (other was not pro version), its pretty cheap and very strong for any unexcepted accident. Mine was secondhand which I buy from 2018 and still rock. Have IPS 720p LCD, big chunk battery 4100mAh, Aluminum Case and without any silly design (notch, less bezell, big screen).

### Operation System
I use <b>Alpine Linux</b> as my operation system, I also have <b>Windows 8.1</b> on my second HDD for certain thing cause my laptop wasnt good enough running virtual machine. <b>Alpine Linux</b> almost have anything what needed, and very lightweight and simple.

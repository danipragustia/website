## Who I am
I graduated from Senior High School as Software engineering, I learn **web** progamming back the days.

## Why choosing me?
I simply would take costumers as 'person' and serve as 'family-friendly', contract can flexible and more convience way without any worries.
I can make your dream website or web application as well, you got fully potential and control over your program. And the program output as **100% Open Source** so nothing hidden stuff!

## How about price?
Price depends how much spend time per day, I recognize myself as people have passion on making good software not as the fast one. So if the project was interest for me, I would give price more less or even free if possible.

## Terms
- If the software would be using by many people, program should be included with <b>Source Code</b>.
